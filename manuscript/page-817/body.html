<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> These amazing engagements of mine&mdash;what have they been? Dining once with the Coles&mdash;and having a ball talked of, which never took place. I can understand you&mdash;(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)&mdash;your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one&mdash;and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling his accounts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

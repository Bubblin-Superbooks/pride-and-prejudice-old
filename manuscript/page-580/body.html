I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing&mdash;to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane Fairfax&rsquo;s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;&mdash;and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day&mdash;for we arrived together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

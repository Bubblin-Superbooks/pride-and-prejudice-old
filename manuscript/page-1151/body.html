<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncle&rsquo;s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!&mdash;But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.&mdash;I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.</p></div> </div>

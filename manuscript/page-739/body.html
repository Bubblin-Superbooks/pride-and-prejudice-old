<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be&mdash;for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.&mdash;However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.&mdash;I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.&mdash;I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us.</p></div> </div>

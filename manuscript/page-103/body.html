She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not a fault to find with her person,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed.

That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma&rsquo;s brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.</p></div> </div>

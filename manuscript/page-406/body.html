<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>only two pages you see&mdash;hardly two&mdash;and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened, &lsquo;Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her&mdash;every word of it&mdash;I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed, though my mother&rsquo;s eyes are not so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother&rsquo;s are really very good indeed.</p></div> </div>

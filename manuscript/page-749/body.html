I will say that for you.&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful&mdash;and in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,</p><p>&ldquo;So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

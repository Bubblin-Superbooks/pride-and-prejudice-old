If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.&mdash;Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F&mdash;, who would never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.&mdash;The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.</p></div> </div>

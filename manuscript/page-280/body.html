<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.&mdash;Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea&mdash;a quarter of a mile off&mdash;very comfortable. You should have consulted Perry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;&mdash;only consider how great it would have been.&mdash;An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.&mdash;Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very ill-judged measure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

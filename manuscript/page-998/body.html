<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her mind the whole day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say she had.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends&mdash;but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible&mdash;I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton&rsquo;s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!&mdash;A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove&mdash;and as to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere.</p></div> </div>

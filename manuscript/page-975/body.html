We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do, I do like him,&rdquo; she replied, with tears in her eyes, &ldquo;I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy.</p></div> </div>

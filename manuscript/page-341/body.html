Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman&rsquo;s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?&rdquo;</p><p>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;I see what you are feeling,&rdquo; replied Charlotte. &ldquo;You must be surprised, very much surprised&mdash;so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.

Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?&mdash;that you have never thought seriously of her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never, madam,&rdquo; cried he, affronted in his turn: &ldquo;never, I assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!&mdash;Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.</p></div> </div>

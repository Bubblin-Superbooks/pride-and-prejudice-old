<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma&rsquo;s doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.&mdash;They only give a little polish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I either depend more upon Emma&rsquo;s good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked last night!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

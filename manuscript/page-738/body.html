<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You appear to feel a great deal&mdash;but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax&rsquo;s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than&rdquo;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If we set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. We have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.&mdash;I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to.</p></div> </div>

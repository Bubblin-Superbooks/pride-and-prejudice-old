The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like her appearance,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. &ldquo;She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,&rdquo; replied Emma; &ldquo;but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life.&mdash;She is an odd woman!&mdash;But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on Frank&rsquo;s account; for I do believe her to be very fond of him.</p></div> </div>

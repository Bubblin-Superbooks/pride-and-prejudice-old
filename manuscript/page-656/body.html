<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Dancing with open windows!&mdash;I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! sir&mdash;but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have often known it done myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you indeed, sir?&mdash;Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it over&mdash;but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

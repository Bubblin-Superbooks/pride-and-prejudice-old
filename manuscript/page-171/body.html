Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; cried she playfully. &ldquo;I know that is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in&mdash;what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.

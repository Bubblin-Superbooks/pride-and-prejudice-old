<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?&mdash;what can it be? I have not an idea&mdash;I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was&mdash;and who could be the young lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?</p><p>Can it be Neptune?</p><p>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

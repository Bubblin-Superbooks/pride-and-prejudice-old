I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They have none of them much to recommend them,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

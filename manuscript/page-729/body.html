<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride? It ought to be no recommendation to you. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady&mdash;and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to her. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

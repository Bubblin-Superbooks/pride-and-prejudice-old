Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying&mdash;and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy&mdash;a little fearful of my sister&rsquo;s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.</p></div> </div>

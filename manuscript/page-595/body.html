<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, Lizzy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet one day, &ldquo;what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane&rsquo;s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man&mdash;and I do not suppose there&rsquo;s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

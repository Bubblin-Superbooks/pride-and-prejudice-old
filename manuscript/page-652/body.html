I bring a new proposal on the subject:&mdash;a thought of my father&rsquo;s, which waits only your approbation to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Crown!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.</p></div> </div>

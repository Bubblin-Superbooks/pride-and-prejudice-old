<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Emma was just describing the nature of her friend&rsquo;s complaint;&mdash;&ldquo;a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them.&rdquo; Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,</p><p>&ldquo;A sore-throat!&mdash;I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks. Why does not Perry see her?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning&rsquo;s party. Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing&mdash;and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it. However, I shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

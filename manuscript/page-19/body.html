<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

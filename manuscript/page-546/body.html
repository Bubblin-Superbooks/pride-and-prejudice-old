There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston, &ldquo;if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And no great harm if it does,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse. &ldquo;The sooner every party breaks up, the better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma&rsquo;s going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body&rsquo;s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse&rsquo;s doing it would be more thought of than any other person&rsquo;s in the room.</p></div> </div>

It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.

It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride&mdash;for he is very proud of what his father was&mdash;have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.</p></div> </div>

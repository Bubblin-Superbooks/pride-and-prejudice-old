<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I ever wish to be,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth very warmly. &ldquo;I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no right to give my opinion,&rdquo; said Wickham, &ldquo;as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish&mdash;and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces!&mdash;I shall often have a niece with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know Miss Bates&rsquo;s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred times&mdash;but are you acquainted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury. By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax.</p></div> </div>

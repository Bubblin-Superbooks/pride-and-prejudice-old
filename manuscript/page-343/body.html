<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Smith!&mdash;message to Miss Smith!&mdash;What could she possibly mean!&rdquo;&mdash;And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.&rdquo;</p><p>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,&mdash;but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,&mdash;he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.</p></div> </div>

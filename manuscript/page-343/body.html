<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins&rsquo;s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.&rdquo;</p><p>Elizabeth quietly answered &ldquo;Undoubtedly;&rdquo; and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte&rsquo;s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.</p></div> </div>

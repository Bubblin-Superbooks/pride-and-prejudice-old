<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But I tell you, Miss Lizzy&mdash;if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all&mdash;and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you&mdash;and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

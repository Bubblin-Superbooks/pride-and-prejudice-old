I could not excuse a man&rsquo;s having more music than love&mdash;more ear than eye&mdash;a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was her very particular friend, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor comfort!&rdquo; said Emma, laughing. &ldquo;One would rather have a stranger preferred than one&rsquo;s very particular friend&mdash;with a stranger it might not recur again&mdash;but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!&mdash;Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

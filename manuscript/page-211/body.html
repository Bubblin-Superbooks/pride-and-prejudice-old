<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, if there is time.&mdash;But&mdash;(in a very depressed tone)&mdash;she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer&mdash;but it seems a case of necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas&mdash;though you know it is longer since they were with him, than with us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

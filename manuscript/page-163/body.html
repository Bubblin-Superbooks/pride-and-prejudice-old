He owns it himself without disguise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding&mdash;certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

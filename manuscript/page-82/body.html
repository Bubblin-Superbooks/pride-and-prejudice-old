Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.</p><p>She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.</p><p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner&rsquo;s shop just over the way.</p></div> </div>

I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My object then,&rdquo; replied Darcy, &ldquo;was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.</p></div> </div>

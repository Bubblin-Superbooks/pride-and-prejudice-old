<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma&rsquo;am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said her ladyship, &ldquo;you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

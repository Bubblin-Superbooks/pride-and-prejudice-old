Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford&mdash;between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh&rsquo;s footstool, that she said, &lsquo;Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma&rsquo;s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours&mdash;Mrs. Weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.</p><p>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates&rsquo;s, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates&rsquo;s parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</p></div> </div>

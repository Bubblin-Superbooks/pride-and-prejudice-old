<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.&mdash;&ldquo;Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or here&mdash;and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated&mdash;which is the exact truth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

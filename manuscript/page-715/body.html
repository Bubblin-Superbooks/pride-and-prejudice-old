<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse&mdash;(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father&rsquo;s state of health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?&mdash;Indeed he should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

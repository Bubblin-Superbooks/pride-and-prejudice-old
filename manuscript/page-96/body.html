I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through&mdash;and very good lists they were&mdash;very well chosen, and very neatly arranged&mdash;sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen&mdash;I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.</p></div> </div>

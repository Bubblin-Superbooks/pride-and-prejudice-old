<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I hope, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, &ldquo;that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in&mdash;and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But&mdash;good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell&mdash;I must speak to Hill this moment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

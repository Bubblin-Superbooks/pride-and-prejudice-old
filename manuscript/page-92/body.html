<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;MY DEAREST LIZZY,&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones&mdash;therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me&mdash;and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.&mdash;Yours, etc.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, &ldquo;if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness&mdash;if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

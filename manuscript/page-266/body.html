<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine&rsquo;s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&rsquo;nnight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

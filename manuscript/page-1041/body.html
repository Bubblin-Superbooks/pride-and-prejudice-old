Composure with a witness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman, before her face, and not resent it.&mdash;That is a degree of placidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly. He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay&mdash;but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

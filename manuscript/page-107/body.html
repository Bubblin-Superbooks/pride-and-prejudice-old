But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;as can well be; and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s account.</p></div> </div>

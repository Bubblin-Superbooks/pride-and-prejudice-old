A most delightful place!&mdash;Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How should you have liked making sermons?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;&mdash;but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.

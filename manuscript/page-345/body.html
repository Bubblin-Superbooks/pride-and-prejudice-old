<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; cried Mr. Elton, &ldquo;what can be the meaning of this?&mdash;Miss Smith!&mdash;I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence&mdash;never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very sorry&mdash;extremely sorry&mdash;But, Miss Smith, indeed!&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.</p></div> </div>

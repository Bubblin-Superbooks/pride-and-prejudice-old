But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way&mdash;teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</p><p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain&mdash;that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences&mdash;cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure&mdash;and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.</p></div> </div>

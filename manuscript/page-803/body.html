<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect&mdash;but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s illness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?&mdash;To Bath, or to Clifton?&rdquo; &ldquo;She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

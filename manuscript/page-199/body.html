<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,&mdash;me, of all people, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!&mdash;The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;</p></div> </div>

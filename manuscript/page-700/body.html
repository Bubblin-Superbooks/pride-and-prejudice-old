Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved&mdash;which gives Isabella all her popularity.&mdash;I have it not&mdash;but I know how to prize and respect it.&mdash;Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!&mdash;I would not change you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!&mdash;Harriet is worth a hundred such&mdash;And for a wife&mdash;a sensible man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;it is invaluable. I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

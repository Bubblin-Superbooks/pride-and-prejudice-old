I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,&rdquo; said Mr. Collins very gravely&mdash;&ldquo;but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.</p></div> </div>

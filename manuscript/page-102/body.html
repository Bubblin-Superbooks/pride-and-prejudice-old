Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma&rsquo;s being pretty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty! say beautiful rather.

But I am a partial old friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Such an eye!&mdash;the true hazle eye&mdash;and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!

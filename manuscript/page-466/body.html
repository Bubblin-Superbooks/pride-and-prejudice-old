<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I can answer your question,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My fingers,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women&rsquo;s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault&mdash;because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman&rsquo;s of superior execution.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

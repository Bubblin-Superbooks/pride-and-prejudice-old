<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&mdash;How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!&mdash;The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband&rsquo;s plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment&mdash;less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself&mdash;but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying&mdash;&ldquo;Those matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way.&rdquo; But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother&rsquo;s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,</p><p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,&rdquo; turning to Charlotte, &ldquo;I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.</p></div> </div>

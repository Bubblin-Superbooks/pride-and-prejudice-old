<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly&mdash;I would not have you out in a shower!&mdash;We think she is the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!&mdash;I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.&mdash;Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!&mdash;Good morning to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

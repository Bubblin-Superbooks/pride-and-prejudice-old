<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one&rsquo;s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

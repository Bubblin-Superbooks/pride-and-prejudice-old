He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely&mdash;thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly.

In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man&mdash;one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles&mdash;Mr. Knightley.</p></div> </div>

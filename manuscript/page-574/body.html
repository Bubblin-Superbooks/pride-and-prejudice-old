It is excellent news&mdash;capital news&mdash;and about a certain person we all like!&rdquo;</p><p>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham&rsquo;s marrying Mary King. There&rsquo;s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

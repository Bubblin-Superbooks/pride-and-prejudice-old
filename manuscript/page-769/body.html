Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our authority.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, &ldquo;I certainly do feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.&mdash;Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

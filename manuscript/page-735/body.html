<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration&mdash;but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.&mdash;Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton&rsquo;s knight-errantry on the subject.&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.&mdash;I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.&mdash;A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and ladylike&mdash;and with such talents!&mdash;I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point.</p></div> </div>

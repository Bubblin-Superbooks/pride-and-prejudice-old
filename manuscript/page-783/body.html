<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment&rsquo;s notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

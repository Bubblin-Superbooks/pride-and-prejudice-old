<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course&mdash;and speedily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

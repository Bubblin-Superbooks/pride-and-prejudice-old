<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away.&mdash;Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it. I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for timidity&mdash;and I am sure one does not often meet with it.&mdash;But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

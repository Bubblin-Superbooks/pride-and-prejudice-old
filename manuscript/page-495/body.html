I remembered what I used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one&rsquo;s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&mdash;I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object&mdash;but I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.&mdash;Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.&mdash;She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.&mdash;Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;&mdash;</p></div> </div>

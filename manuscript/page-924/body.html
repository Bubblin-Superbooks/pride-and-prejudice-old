<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are then resolved to have him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

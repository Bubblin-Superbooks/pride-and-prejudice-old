You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&mdash;What is this?&rdquo; cried Mr. Weston, &ldquo;about Perry and a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied his son, laughing, &ldquo;I seem to have had it from nobody.&mdash;Very odd!&mdash;I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston&rsquo;s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars&mdash;but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.</p></div> </div>

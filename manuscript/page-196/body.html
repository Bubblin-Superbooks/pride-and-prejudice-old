<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing that you want&mdash;consideration, independence, a proper home&mdash;it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Woodhouse!&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Dear Miss Woodhouse,&rdquo; was all that Harriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she ought. Mr. Elton&rsquo;s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It really was so. Without scruple&mdash;without apology&mdash;without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,</p><p>&ldquo;I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget yourself&mdash;you take me for my friend&mdash;any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

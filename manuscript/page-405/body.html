<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope she is well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. You are so kind!&rdquo; replied the happily deceived aunt, while eagerly hunting for the letter.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! here it is. I was sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her&mdash;a letter from Jane&mdash;that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife&mdash;and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;&mdash;but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter&mdash;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who &ldquo;could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.&rdquo;&mdash;He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,</p><p>&ldquo;Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?&mdash;Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is she unwell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, not at all&mdash;only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone, and that you know&mdash;(nodding towards her father)&mdash;Humph!&mdash;Can you come?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

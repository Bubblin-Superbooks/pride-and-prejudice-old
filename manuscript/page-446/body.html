<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley presently, &ldquo;I have a piece of news for you. You like news&mdash;and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of large fortune?&mdash;You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me&mdash;but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The evil of the distance from Enscombe,&rdquo; said Mr. Weston, &ldquo;is, that Mrs. Churchill, asweunderstand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank&rsquo;s last letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle&rsquo;s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of weakness&mdash;but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.&mdash;So Frank writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.

It has been completely unexpected. That is, I always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn up&mdash;but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding.</p></div> </div>

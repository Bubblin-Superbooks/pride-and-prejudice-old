GARDINER.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham&rsquo;s removal from the &mdash;&mdash;shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia&rsquo;s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.</p><p>&ldquo;She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s regiment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?&mdash;why so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think they will neither of them do the other any good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we feel!&mdash;Not think they will do each other any good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

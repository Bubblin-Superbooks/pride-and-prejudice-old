<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; &ldquo;then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

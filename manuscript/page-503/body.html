<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name&mdash;I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be sure we do,&rdquo; cried his father; &ldquo;Mrs. Bates&mdash;we passed her house&mdash;I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is. Call upon her, by all means.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one&rsquo;s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother&rsquo;s, it must have been a real indulgence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am happy you approved,&rdquo; said Emma, smiling; &ldquo;but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; said her father instantly; &ldquo;that I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night&mdash;if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma&rsquo;s sensations; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.</p><p>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before her, one which she only could be competent to make&mdash;the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.&mdash;She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved&mdash;and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.</p></div> </div>

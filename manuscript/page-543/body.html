<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am not fond of dinner-visiting,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;I never was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us&mdash;take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.&rdquo; Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

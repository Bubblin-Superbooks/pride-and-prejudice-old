They must not do less than others, or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment. A dinner there must be.

Besides the Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course&mdash;and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:&mdash;but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet&rsquo;s begging to be allowed to decline it.</p></div> </div>

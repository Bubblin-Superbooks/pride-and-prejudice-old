She was warmly gratified&mdash;and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.&mdash;He took her hand;&mdash;whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say&mdash;she might, perhaps, have rather offered it&mdash;but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips&mdash;when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.</p></div> </div>

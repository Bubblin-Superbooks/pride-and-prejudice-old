Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other!&mdash;Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!&mdash;Beautiful lace!&mdash;Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!&mdash;Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one.</p></div> </div>

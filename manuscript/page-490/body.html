Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man&mdash;he is a great friend of Darcy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth drily; &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Care of him!

From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

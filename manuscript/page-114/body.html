Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, good man!&mdash;thought Emma&mdash;but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don&rsquo;t pretend to be in raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do. Harriet&rsquo;s features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;</p></div> </div>

Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.

Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

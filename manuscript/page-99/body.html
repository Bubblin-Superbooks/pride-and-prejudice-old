But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you will blind yourself&rsquo;&mdash;for tears were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate&mdash;such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out&mdash;do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune&mdash;(again dispersing her tears)&mdash;but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you&mdash;she is not able&mdash;she is gone into her own room&mdash;I want her to lie down upon the bed.</p></div> </div>

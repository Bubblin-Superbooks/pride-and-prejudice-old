<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter&mdash;to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William&rsquo;s good breeding carried him through it all;</p></div> </div>

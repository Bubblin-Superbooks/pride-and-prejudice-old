And Jane declares&mdash;Well!&mdash;(as soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!&mdash;This is admirable!&mdash;Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.&mdash;So well lighted up!&mdash;Jane, Jane, look!&mdash;did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. &lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Stokes,&rsquo; said I&mdash;but I had not time for more.&rdquo; She was now met by Mrs. Weston.&mdash;&ldquo;Very well, I thank you, ma&rsquo;am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!&mdash;seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.</p></div> </div>

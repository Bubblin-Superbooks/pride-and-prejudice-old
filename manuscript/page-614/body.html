My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?&mdash;I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.&mdash;Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see her&mdash;and now we are such a nice party, she cannot refuse.&mdash;&lsquo;Aye, pray do,&rsquo; said Mr. Frank Churchill, &lsquo;Miss Woodhouse&rsquo;s opinion of the instrument will be worth having.&rsquo;&mdash;But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.</p></div> </div>

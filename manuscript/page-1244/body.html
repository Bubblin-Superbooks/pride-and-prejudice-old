The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet&rsquo;s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.&mdash;What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.</p><p>Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them.

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! but those two lines are&rdquo;&mdash;</p><p>&mdash;&ldquo;The best of all. Granted;&mdash;for private enjoyment; and for private enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know, because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its meaning change. But take it away, and all appropriation ceases, and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

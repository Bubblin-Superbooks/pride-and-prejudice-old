She must tell you herself what she is&mdash;yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.&mdash;Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.&mdash;She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery.</p></div> </div>

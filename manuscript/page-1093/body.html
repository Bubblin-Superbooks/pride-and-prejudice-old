<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement&rsquo;s becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:&mdash;but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for &ldquo;such things,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;always got about.&rdquo; Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so.</p></div> </div>

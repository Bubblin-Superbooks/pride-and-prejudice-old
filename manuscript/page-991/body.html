<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:&rsquo; but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door&mdash;I was quite ashamed&mdash;but somehow there was a little bustle&mdash;for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. &lsquo;It is only Mrs. Cole,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.&rsquo; But then Patty came in, and said it was you. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And you must be off this very morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates&rsquo;s powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates&rsquo;s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my visit, then&rdquo;&mdash;</p></div> </div>

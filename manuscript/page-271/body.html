But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy&mdash;except when it has been quite an influenza.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

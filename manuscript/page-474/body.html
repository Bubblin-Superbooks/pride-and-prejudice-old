<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding&mdash;though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

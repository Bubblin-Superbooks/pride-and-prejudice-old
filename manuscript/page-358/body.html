<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Miss Bingley&rsquo;s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother&rsquo;s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.</p><p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy&rsquo;s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother&rsquo;s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.</p></div> </div>

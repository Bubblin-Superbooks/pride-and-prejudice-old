He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot pretend to be sorry,&rdquo; said Wickham, after a short interruption, &ldquo;that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.&rdquo; Wickham only shook his head.</p></div> </div>

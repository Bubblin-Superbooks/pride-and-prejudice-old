You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at&mdash;or my tour to read&mdash;or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may be&mdash;but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I want a change.</p></div> </div>

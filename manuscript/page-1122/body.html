In one respect he is the object of my envy.&rdquo;</p><p>Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally different&mdash;the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,</p><p>&ldquo;You will not ask me what is the point of envy.&mdash;You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.&mdash;You are wise&mdash;but I cannot be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

A fortnight&rsquo;s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, &ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there.</p></div> </div>

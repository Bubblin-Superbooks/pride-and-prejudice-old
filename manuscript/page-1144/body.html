<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to think it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.&mdash;Had she refused, I should have gone mad.&mdash;But you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing this?&mdash;What did you look forward to?&mdash;To any thing, every thing&mdash;to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.</p></div> </div>

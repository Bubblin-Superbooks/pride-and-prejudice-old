<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends&mdash;has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of&mdash;of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to&mdash;she is lost for ever.&rdquo;</p><p>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. &ldquo;When I consider,&rdquo; she added in a yet more agitated voice, &ldquo;that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only&mdash;some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all&mdash;all too late now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

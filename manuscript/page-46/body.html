<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough&mdash;one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design&mdash;to take the good of everybody&rsquo;s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad&mdash;belongs to you alone. And so you like this man&rsquo;s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

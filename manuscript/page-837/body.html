Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better.&rdquo;</p><p>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston&rsquo;s attention was chained; but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.</p><p>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. &ldquo;I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!&mdash;I believe we drive faster than any body.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;&mdash;I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife&mdash;for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

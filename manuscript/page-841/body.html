<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?&mdash;It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:&mdash;but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely&mdash;and there was a mat to step upon&mdash;I shall never forget his extreme politeness.&mdash;Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother&rsquo;s spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?&mdash;Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?&mdash;Ah! here&rsquo;s Miss Woodhouse.&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?&mdash;Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!&mdash;Such a transformation!&mdash;Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)&mdash;that would be rude&mdash;but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look&mdash;how do you like Jane&rsquo;s hair?&mdash;You are a judge.&mdash;She did it all herself.</p></div> </div>

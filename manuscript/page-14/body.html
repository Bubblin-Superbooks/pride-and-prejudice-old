<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor&rsquo;s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</p><p>The real evils, indeed, of Emma&rsquo;s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments.</p></div> </div>

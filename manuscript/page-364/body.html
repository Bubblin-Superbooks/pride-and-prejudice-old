<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Consider Mr. Collins&rsquo;s respectability, and Charlotte&rsquo;s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody&rsquo;s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.</p></div> </div>

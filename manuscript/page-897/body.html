<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.&rdquo;</p><p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.</p><p>&ldquo;You are a good girl;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

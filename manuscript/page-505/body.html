I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might as well inquire,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you&mdash;had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

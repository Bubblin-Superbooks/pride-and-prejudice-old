<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty!&mdash;is he indeed?&mdash;Well, I could not have thought it&mdash;and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does fly indeed!&mdash;and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept. 28th&mdash;and began, &lsquo;My dear Madam,&rsquo; but I forget how it went on; and it was signed &lsquo;F. C. Weston Churchill.&rsquo;&mdash;I remember that perfectly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

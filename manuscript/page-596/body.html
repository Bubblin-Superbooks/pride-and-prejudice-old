Yes, yes, they will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!

They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a subject which they could not mention before me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

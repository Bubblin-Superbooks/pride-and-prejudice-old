I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &ldquo;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!

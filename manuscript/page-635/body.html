<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Knightley I declare!&mdash;I must speak to him if possible, just to thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my mother&rsquo;s room you know. I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet so!&mdash;Our little room so honoured!&rdquo;</p><p>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s attention, and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo; ye do?&mdash;how d&rsquo;ye do?&mdash;Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

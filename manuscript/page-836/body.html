<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;&mdash;he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.</p></div> </div>

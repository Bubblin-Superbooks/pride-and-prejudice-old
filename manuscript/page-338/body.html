<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Collins, &ldquo;I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship&rsquo;s concurrence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Pray read on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&rsquo; Mr. Collins moreover adds, &lsquo;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia&rsquo;s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.</p></div> </div>

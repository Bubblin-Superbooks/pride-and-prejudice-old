Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last night; how extremely pleasant.&mdash;Did you ever see such dancing?&mdash;Was not it delightful?&mdash;Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any thing equal to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

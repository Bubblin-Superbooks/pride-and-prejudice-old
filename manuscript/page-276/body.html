<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!&rdquo; said Mrs. John Knightley.&mdash;&ldquo;It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always regret excessively on dear Emma&rsquo;s account that she cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a delightful companion for Emma.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,</p><p>&ldquo;Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank&rsquo;s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife&rsquo;s: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill&rsquo;d them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

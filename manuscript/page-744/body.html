<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane.</p><p>&ldquo;We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear Emma&mdash;but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right, Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley warmly, &ldquo;Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

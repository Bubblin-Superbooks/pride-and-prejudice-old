And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns&mdash;my winter walk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot do better, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

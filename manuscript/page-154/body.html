<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother&rsquo;s conversation with Miss Bennet.</p><p>Miss Bingley&rsquo;s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, &ldquo;How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!</p></div> </div>

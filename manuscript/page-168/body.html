After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s hands to shift as she can;&mdash;to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s line, to have Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.</p></div> </div>

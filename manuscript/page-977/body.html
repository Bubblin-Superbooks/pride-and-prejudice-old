I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.&rdquo;</p><p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.</p><p>&ldquo;This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow&rsquo;s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle&rsquo;s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!&mdash;The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time&mdash;when I saw him coming&mdash;his noble look&mdash;and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.&mdash;Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.&mdash;But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being returned. Consider what you are about.</p></div> </div>

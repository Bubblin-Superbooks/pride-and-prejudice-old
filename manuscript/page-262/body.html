I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.&rdquo; She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane&rsquo;s being in the fairest way for happiness.</p></div> </div>

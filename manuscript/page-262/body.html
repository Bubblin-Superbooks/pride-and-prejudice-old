Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;very true.

But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which do you mean?&rdquo; and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: &ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

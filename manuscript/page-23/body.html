<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;They are to be put into Mr. Weston&rsquo;s stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter&rsquo;s being housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her&mdash;James is so obliged to you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.</p></div> </div>

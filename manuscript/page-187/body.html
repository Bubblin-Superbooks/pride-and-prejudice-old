<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s, had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse&rsquo;s help, to get a great many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. &ldquo;So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young&mdash;he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.&rdquo; And it always ended in &ldquo;Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

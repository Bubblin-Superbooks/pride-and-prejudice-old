The result of his reverie was, &ldquo;No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.&mdash;I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you.&rdquo; And soon afterwards, &ldquo;Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman&mdash;but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.&rdquo;</p><p>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, very soon.

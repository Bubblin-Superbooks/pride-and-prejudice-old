Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.</p><p>&ldquo;Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.</p></div> </div>

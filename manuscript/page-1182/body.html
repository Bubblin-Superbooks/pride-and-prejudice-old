<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her&mdash;and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.&mdash;When it was thus settled on her sister&rsquo;s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.&mdash;Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s carriage.&mdash;It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.</p><p>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.</p></div> </div>

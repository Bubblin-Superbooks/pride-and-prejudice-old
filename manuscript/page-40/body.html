It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness.

She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother&rsquo;s unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.</p></div> </div>

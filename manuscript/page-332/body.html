<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. &ldquo;It keeps him in good humour,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&rdquo; Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte&rsquo;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas&rsquo;s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.</p></div> </div>

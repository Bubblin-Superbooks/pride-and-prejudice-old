Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain&mdash;but extremely elegant and amiable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so considerate!&mdash;But however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her&mdash;and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley&rsquo;s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother&rsquo;s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:</p><p>&ldquo;Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the &mdash;&mdash;shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

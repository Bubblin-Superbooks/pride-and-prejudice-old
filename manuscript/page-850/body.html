My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife&rsquo;s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.</p><p>&ldquo;He is as fine a fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, &ldquo;as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

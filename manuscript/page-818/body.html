You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No really,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth; &ldquo;I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement&rsquo;s, because Wickham&rsquo;s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o&rsquo;clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.</p></div> </div>

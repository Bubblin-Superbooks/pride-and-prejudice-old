<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you&rsquo;ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything.</p></div> </div>

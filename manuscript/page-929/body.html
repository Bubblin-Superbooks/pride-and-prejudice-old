<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me&mdash;and my caro sposo walking by. I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;&mdash;and very long walks, you know&mdash;in summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s. I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Donwell!&rdquo; cried his wife.&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Mr. E., you have not been to Donwell!&mdash;You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.&mdash;Such a dreadful broiling morning!&mdash;I went over the fields too&mdash;(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.</p></div> </div>

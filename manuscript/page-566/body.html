And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable&mdash;indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again&mdash;yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that &ldquo;he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank&mdash;such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.</p></div> </div>

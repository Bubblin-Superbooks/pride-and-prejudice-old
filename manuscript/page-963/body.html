<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own management; but to-day you are got back again&mdash;and as I cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always with me. You are always with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dating from three o&rsquo;clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

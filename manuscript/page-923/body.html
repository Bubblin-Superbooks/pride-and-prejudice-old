<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You had better explore to Donwell,&rdquo; replied Mr. Knightley. &ldquo;That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening fast.&rdquo;</p><p>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the &ldquo;Oh! I should like it of all things,&rdquo; was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again and again to come&mdash;much oftener than he doubted&mdash;and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.</p></div> </div>

Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me&mdash;Jane and her aunt.&mdash;The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family. Don&rsquo;t scruple. I know you are attached to them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:&mdash;but as you like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,&mdash;probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see.</p></div> </div>

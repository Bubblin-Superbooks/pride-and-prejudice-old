Frank comes to-morrow&mdash;I had a letter this morning&mdash;we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty&mdash;he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

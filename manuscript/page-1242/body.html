<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so&mdash;for at that time I was a fool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet&rsquo;s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin&rsquo;s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin&rsquo;s cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.&mdash;Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

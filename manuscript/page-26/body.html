<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the bye&mdash;I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

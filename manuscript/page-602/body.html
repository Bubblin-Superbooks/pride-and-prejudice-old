<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister&rsquo;s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone&rsquo;s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

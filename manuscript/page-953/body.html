<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy&mdash;I am sick of England&mdash;and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

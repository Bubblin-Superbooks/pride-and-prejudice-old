What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;&mdash;and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A house of her own!&mdash;But where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large.&mdash;And you have never any odd humours, my dear.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth; &ldquo;but how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it&mdash;or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence&mdash;in short anything or nothing.</p></div> </div>

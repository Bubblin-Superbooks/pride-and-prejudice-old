What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,&rdquo; said Jane: &ldquo;I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Their conduct has been such,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

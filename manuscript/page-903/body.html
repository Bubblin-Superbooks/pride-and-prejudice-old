<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don&rsquo;t you remember grandmama&rsquo;s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to&mdash;very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother&mdash;indeed I do not know who is not&mdash;and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not.</p></div> </div>

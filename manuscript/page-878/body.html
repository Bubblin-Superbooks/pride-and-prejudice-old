<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began:</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Woodhouse&mdash;if you are at leisure&mdash;I have something that I should like to tell you&mdash;a sort of confession to make&mdash;and then, you know, it will be over.&rdquo;</p><p>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a seriousness in Harriet&rsquo;s manner which prepared her, quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.</p><p>&ldquo;It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered creature in onerespect, it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it.</p></div> </div>

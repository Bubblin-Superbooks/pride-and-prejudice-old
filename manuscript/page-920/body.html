<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That will make your ladyship&rsquo;s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father&rsquo;s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient&mdash;though untitled&mdash;families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

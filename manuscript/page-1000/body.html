Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and say, Come ma&rsquo;am, do not let us think about it any more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.

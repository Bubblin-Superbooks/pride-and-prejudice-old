<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following&mdash;as you will find from Jane&rsquo;s letter. So sudden!&mdash;You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of her illness&mdash;but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane&rsquo;s letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her.</p></div> </div>

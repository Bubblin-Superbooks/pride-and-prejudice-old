It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that expression of &lsquo;violently in love&rsquo; is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour&rsquo;s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

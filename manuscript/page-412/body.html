<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean&mdash;I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses&mdash;and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them&mdash;for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter&rsquo;s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

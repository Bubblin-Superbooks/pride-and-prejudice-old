<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge&mdash;most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman&rsquo;s education. My father was not only fond of this young man&rsquo;s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.</p></div> </div>

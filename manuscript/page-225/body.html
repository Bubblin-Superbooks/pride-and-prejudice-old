<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband&rsquo;s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man&rsquo;s eyes as I am in my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

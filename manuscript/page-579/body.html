Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. &lsquo;Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!&rsquo;&mdash;but with many, many thanks&mdash;&lsquo;there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.&rsquo; I was quite surprized;&mdash;very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a very kind attention&mdash;and so thoughtful an attention!&mdash;the sort of thing that so few men would think of.

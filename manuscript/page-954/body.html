<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When I wrote that letter,&rdquo; replied Darcy, &ldquo;I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so.</p></div> </div>

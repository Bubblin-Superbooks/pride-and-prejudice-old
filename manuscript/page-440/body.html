<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf&rsquo;s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &lsquo;Lady Catherine,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you have given me a treasure.&rsquo; Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.</p><p>&ldquo;A very pleasant evening,&rdquo; he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers swept away;&mdash;&ldquo;particularly pleasant.

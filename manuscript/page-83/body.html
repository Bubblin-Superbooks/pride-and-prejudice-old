He did not think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him so very plain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is very plain, undoubtedly&mdash;remarkably plain:&mdash;but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much;</p></div> </div>

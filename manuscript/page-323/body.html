<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother&rsquo;s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most willingly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John Knightley, &ldquo;and I think we shall have a good deal of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Christmas weather,&rdquo; observed Mr. Elton. &ldquo;Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day&rsquo;s party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend&rsquo;s house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se&rsquo;nnight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

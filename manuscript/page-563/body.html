She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:</p><p>&ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.

Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine&rsquo;s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there.</p></div> </div>

She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman&rsquo;s scheme than an elderly man&rsquo;s.

I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon in them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Dixon.&mdash;Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.

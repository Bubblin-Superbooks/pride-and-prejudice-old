<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like it?&mdash;Selina&rsquo;s choice&mdash;handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed&mdash;quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,&mdash;show and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will look well?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

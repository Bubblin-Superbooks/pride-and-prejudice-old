<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship&rsquo;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship&rsquo;s carriages, for she has several.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,&rdquo; added Charlotte, &ldquo;and a most attentive neighbour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

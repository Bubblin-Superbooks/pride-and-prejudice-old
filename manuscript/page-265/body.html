I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s sincerity,&rdquo; said Elizabeth warmly; &ldquo;but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

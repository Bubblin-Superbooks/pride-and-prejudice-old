Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.&rdquo; And upon Elizabeth&rsquo;s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: &ldquo;Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

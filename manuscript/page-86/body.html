When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well&mdash;and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William&rsquo;s in his regimentals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; cried Lydia, &ldquo;my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson&rsquo;s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke&rsquo;s library.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

If she can hesitate as to &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she ought to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to&mdash;but if you would just advise me what I had best do&mdash;No, no, I do not mean that&mdash;As you say, one&rsquo;s mind ought to be quite made up&mdash;One should not be hesitating&mdash;It is a very serious thing.&mdash;It will be safer to say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; perhaps.&mdash;Do you think I had better say &lsquo;No?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

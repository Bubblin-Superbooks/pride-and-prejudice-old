<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Bingley, &ldquo;this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, &lsquo;Bingley, you had better stay till next week,&rsquo; you would probably do it, you would probably not go&mdash;and at another word, might stay a month.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

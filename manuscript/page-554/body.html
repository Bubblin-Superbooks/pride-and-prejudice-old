<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:</p><p>&ldquo;But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

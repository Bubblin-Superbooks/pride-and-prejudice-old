I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.&mdash;I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.&mdash;We are quite well.&mdash;This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.&mdash;I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.&mdash;I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.</p></div> </div>

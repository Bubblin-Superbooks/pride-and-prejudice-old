But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Money! My uncle!&rdquo; cried Jane, &ldquo;what do you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle&rsquo;s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

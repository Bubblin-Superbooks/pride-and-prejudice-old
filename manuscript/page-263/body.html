But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister&rsquo;s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s regard.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Knightley!&mdash;I could not have believed it. Knightley!&mdash;never seen him in her life before, and call him Knightley!&mdash;and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her carosposo, and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs. Weston!&mdash;Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.</p></div> </div>

He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer&rsquo;s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

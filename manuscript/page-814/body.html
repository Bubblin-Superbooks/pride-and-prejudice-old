Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called &ldquo;Mrs. Wickham&rdquo; by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, mamma,&rdquo; said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, &ldquo;and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

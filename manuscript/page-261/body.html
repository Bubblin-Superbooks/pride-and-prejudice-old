His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite&rsquo;s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,&rdquo; said Elizabeth angrily; &ldquo;for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

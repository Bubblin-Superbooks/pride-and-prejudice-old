Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her father.&mdash;Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,</p><p>&ldquo;I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the &lsquo;love,&rsquo; which nobody carries?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

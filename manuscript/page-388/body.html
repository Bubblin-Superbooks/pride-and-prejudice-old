<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, you are not serious now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw&mdash;and if he becomes really attached to me&mdash;I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father&rsquo;s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.</p></div> </div>

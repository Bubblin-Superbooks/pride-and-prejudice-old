<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.&mdash;There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman&mdash;and a gentleman of fortune.&mdash;Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.&mdash;That she is a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter, is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen&rsquo;s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.&mdash;She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

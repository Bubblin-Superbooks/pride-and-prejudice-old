I am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold. Walk home!&mdash;you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

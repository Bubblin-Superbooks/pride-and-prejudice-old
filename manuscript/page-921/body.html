<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p><p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p><p>&ldquo;And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will make no promise of the kind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?</p></div> </div>

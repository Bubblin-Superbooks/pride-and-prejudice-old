Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.&mdash;Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in. &ldquo;Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body&mdash;any body at all&mdash;Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied&mdash;and Mrs. Cole had made such a point&mdash;and Mrs. Perry had said so much&mdash;but, except them, Jane would really see nobody.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

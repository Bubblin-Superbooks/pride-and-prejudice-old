I dare say she did not understand me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it&mdash;with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;I know there is not a better creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

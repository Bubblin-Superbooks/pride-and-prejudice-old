<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!&mdash;The strangest things do take place!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted&mdash;they do indeed&mdash;and really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently, so palpably desirable&mdash;what courts the pre-arrangement of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form. You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.</p></div> </div>

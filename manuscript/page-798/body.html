We have notice of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son&rsquo;s hand, presumed to open it&mdash;though it was not directed to me&mdash;it was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr. Weston&mdash;(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.&mdash;A most dangerous precedent indeed!&mdash;I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.&mdash;Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!&mdash;Oh! Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith&rsquo;s being exactly the young friend she wanted&mdash;exactly the something which her home required.

It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away&mdash;and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is odd though,&rdquo; observed his father, &ldquo;that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry&rsquo;s setting up his carriage! and his wife&rsquo;s persuading him to it, out of care for his health&mdash;just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>

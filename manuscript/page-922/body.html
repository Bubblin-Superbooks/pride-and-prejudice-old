<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister&rsquo;s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man&rsquo;s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.</p></div> </div>

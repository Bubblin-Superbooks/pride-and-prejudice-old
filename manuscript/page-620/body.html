<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees&mdash;I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other day&mdash;for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. &lsquo;I am sure you must be,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.</p></div> </div>
